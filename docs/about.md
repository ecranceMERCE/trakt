# About

## Origin

The project started in the context of [Enzo Crance](https://ecrance.net)'s PhD thesis with
[Mitsubishi Electric R&D Centre Europe (MERCE)](https://www.mitsubishielectric-rce.eu/merce-in-france/)
and [Inria Gallinette](https://gallinette.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/), whose goal was to look
for ways to achieve automated proof transfer in dependent type theory, with implementations in the
Rocq proof assistant.

‘Trakt’ means ‘funnel’ in Norwegian, which suited pretty well the purpose of the project.
